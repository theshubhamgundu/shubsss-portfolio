      Life is not about big wins or loud moments. Itâ€™s about the people â€” the ones who stay.
      In friendships, itâ€™s the effort that matters. Be the one who checks in, who listens.
      In love, itâ€™s not the grand gestures, but the small, everyday things that hold meaning.
      In family, the moments spent together erase all stress and remind us where we belong.
      Grow into a person with character, maturity, understanding. Because thatâ€™s what lasts.

      If you expect love to stay the same but put in none of the effort, it wonâ€™t.
      Love fades where effort stops. Itâ€™s not about routine; itâ€™s about consistency.
      The spark doesnâ€™t die â€” itâ€™s just ignored. You get what you water.
